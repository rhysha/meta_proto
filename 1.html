<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_3">A SET BACK</h2>

<p class="calibre1">The  moment  was  not  quite  so  triumphant  as  it  ought  to  have  been.  To  begin with, the resources of Tommy’s pockets were somewhat limited. In the end the fare was managed, the lady recollecting a plebeian twopence, and the driver, still holding the varied assortment of coins in his hand, was prevailed upon to move on, which he did after one last hoarse demand as to what the gentleman thought he was giving him?</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  think  you’ve  given  him  too  much,  Tommy,”  said  Tuppence  innocently.  “I fancy he wants to give some of it back.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Mr. Beresford, at length able to relieve his feelings, “what the—</p>
<p class="calibre1">dickens, did you want to take a taxi for?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was afraid I might be late and keep you waiting,” said Tuppence gently.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Afraid—you—might—be—late! Oh, Lord, I give it up!” said Mr. Beresford.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  really  and  truly,”  continued  Tuppence,  opening  her  eyes  very  wide,  “I haven’t got anything smaller than a five-pound note.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You did that part of it very well, old bean, but all the same the fellow wasn’t taken in—not for a moment!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Tuppence thoughtfully, “he didn’t believe it. That’s the curious part about speaking the truth. No one does believe it. I found that out this morning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now let’s go to lunch. How about the  <i class="calibre5">Savoy? </i>”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy grinned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“How about the  <i class="calibre5">Ritz? </i>”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“On  second  thoughts,  I  prefer  the   <i class="calibre5">Piccadilly</i>.  It’s  nearer.  We  shan’t  have  to take another taxi. Come along.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is this a new brand of humour? Or is your brain really unhinged?” inquired Tommy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your  last  supposition  is  the  correct  one.  I  have  come  into  money,  and  the shock has been too much for me! For that particular form of mental trouble an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>eminent physician recommends unlimited  <i class="calibre5">Hors d’œuvre</i>, Lobster  <i class="calibre5">à l’américane</i>, Chicken Newberg, and Pêche Melba! Let’s go and get them!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tuppence, old girl, what has really come over you?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  unbelieving  one!”  Tuppence  wrenched  open  her  bag.  “Look  here,  and here, and here!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great Jehosaphat! My dear girl, don’t wave Fishers aloft like that!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re not Fishers. They’re five times better than Fishers, and this one’s ten times better!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy groaned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  must  have  been  drinking  unawares!  Am  I  dreaming,  Tuppence,  or  do  I really  behold  a  large  quantity  of  five-pound  notes  being  waved  about  in  a dangerous fashion?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even so, O King!  <i class="calibre5">Now</i>, will you come and have lunch?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll come anywhere. But what have you been doing? Holding up a bank?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“All  in  good  time.  What  an  awful  place  Piccadilly  Circus  is.  There’s  a  huge bus  bearing  down  on  us.  It  would  be  too  terrible  if  they  killed  the  five-pound notes!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grill  room?”  inquired  Tommy,  as  they  reached  the  opposite  pavement  in safety.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The other’s more expensive,” demurred Tuppence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s mere wicked wanton extravagance. Come on below.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That extremely unwholesome menu you were outlining just now? Of course you can—or as much as is good for you, anyway.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And now tell me,” said Tommy, unable to restrain his pent-up curiosity any longer, as they sat in state surrounded by the many  <i class="calibre5">hors d’œuvre</i> of Tuppence’s dreams.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss Cowley told him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the curious part of it is,” she ended, “that I really did invent the name of Jane Finn! I didn’t want to give my own because of poor father—in case I should get mixed up in anything shady.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps that’s so,” said Tommy slowly. “But you didn’t invent it.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.  <i class="calibre5">I</i> told it to you. Don’t you remember, I said yesterday I’d overheard two</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>people  talking  about  a  female  called  Jane  Finn?  That’s  what  brought  the  name into your mind so pat.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So  you  did.  I  remember  now.  How  extraordinary——”  Tuppence  tailed  off into silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. “Tommy!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What were they like, the two men you passed?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy frowned in an effort at remembrance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“One was a big fat sort of chap. Clean shaven, I think—and dark.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s  him,”  cried  Tuppence,  in  an  ungrammatical  squeal.  “That’s Whittington! What was the other man like?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t remember. I didn’t notice him particularly. It was really the outlandish name that caught my attention.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  people  say  that  coincidences  don’t  happen!”  Tuppence  tackled  her Pêche Melba happily.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Tommy had become serious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look here, Tuppence, old girl, what is this going to lead to?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“More money,” replied his companion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  know  that.  You’ve  only  got  one  idea  in  your  head.  What  I  mean  is,  what about the next step? How are you going to keep the game up?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!”  Tuppence  laid  down  her  spoon.  “You’re  right,  Tommy,  it  is  a  bit  of  a poser.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“After  all,  you  know,  you  can’t  bluff  him  forever.  You’re  sure  to  slip  up sooner  or  later.  And,  anyway,  I’m  not  at  all  sure  that  it  isn’t  actionable—</p>
<p class="calibre1">blackmail, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonsense. Blackmail is saying you’ll tell unless you are given money. Now, there’s nothing I could tell, because I don’t really know anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hm,”  said  Tommy  doubtfully.  “Well,  anyway,  what   <i class="calibre5">are</i>  we  going  to  do?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whittington  was  in  a  hurry  to  get  rid  of  you  this  morning,  but  next  time  he’ll want  to  know  something  more  before  he  parts  with  his  money.  He’ll  want  to know how much  <i class="calibre5">you</i> know, and where you got your information from, and a lot of other things that you can’t cope with. What are you going to do about it?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence frowned severely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We must think. Order some Turkish coffee, Tommy. Stimulating to the brain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh, dear, what a lot I have eaten!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  have  made  rather  a  hog  of  yourself!  So  have  I  for  that  matter,  but  I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>flatter  myself  that  my  choice  of  dishes  was  more  judicious  than  yours.  Two coffees.” (This was to the waiter.) “One Turkish, one French.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air, and snubbed Tommy when he spoke to her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be quiet. I’m thinking.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shades of Pelmanism!” said Tommy, and relapsed into silence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“There!” said Tuppence at last. “I’ve got a plan. Obviously what we’ve got to do is to find out more about it all.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy applauded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t  jeer.  We  can  only  find  out  through  Whittington.  We  must  discover where he lives, what he does—sleuth him, in fact! Now I can’t do it, because he knows me, but he only saw you for a minute or two in Lyons’. He’s not likely to recognize you. After all, one young man is much like another.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  repudiate  that  remark  utterly.  I’m  sure  my  pleasing  features  and distinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“My plan is this,” Tuppence went on calmly, “I’ll go alone to-morrow. I’ll put him off again like I did to-day. It doesn’t matter if I don’t get any more money at once. Fifty pounds ought to last us a few days.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or even longer!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll  hang  about  outside.  When  I  come  out  I  shan’t  speak  to  you  in  case he’s  watching.  But  I’ll  take  up  my  stand  somewhere  near,  and  when  he  comes out of the building I’ll drop a handkerchief or something, and off you go!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Off I go where?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Follow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in real life one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street for hours with nothing to do. People will wonder what I’m up to.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not in the city. Every one’s in such a hurry. Probably no one will even notice you at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s  the  second  time  you’ve  made  that  sort  of  remark.  Never  mind,  I forgive  you.  Anyway,  it  will  be  rather  a  lark.  What  are  you  doing  this afternoon?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”  said  Tuppence  meditatively.  “I   <i class="calibre5">had</i>  thought  of  hats!  Or  perhaps  silk stockings! Or perhaps——”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold  hard,”  admonished  Tommy.  “There’s  a  limit  to  fifty  pounds!  But  let’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>do dinner and a show to-night at all events.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rather.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">The day passed pleasantly. The evening even more so. Two of the five-pound notes were now irretrievably dead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They  met  by  arrangement  the  following  morning  and  proceeded  citywards.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy remained on the opposite side of the road while Tuppence plunged into the building.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street, then back again. Just as he came abreast of the building, Tuppence darted across the road.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tommy!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. What’s up?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The place is shut. I can’t make anyone hear.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s odd.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t it? Come up with me, and let’s try again.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy  followed  her.  As  they  passed  the  third  floor  landing  a  young  clerk came  out  of  an  office.  He  hesitated  a  moment,  then  addressed  himself  to Tuppence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were you wanting the Esthonia Glassware?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, please.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s closed down. Since yesterday afternoon. Company being wound up, they say. Not that I’ve ever heard of it myself. But anyway the office is to let.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Th—thank  you,”  faltered  Tuppence.  “I  suppose  you  don’t  know  Mr.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whittington’s address?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Afraid I don’t. They left rather suddenly.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you very much,” said Tommy. “Come on, Tuppence.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">They descended to the street again where they gazed at one another blankly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s torn it,” said Tommy at length.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And I never suspected it,” wailed Tuppence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cheer up, old thing, it can’t be helped.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t it, though!” Tuppence’s little chin shot out defiantly. “Do you think this is the end? If so, you’re wrong. It’s just the beginning!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The beginning of what?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of  our  adventure!  Tommy,  don’t  you  see,  if  they  are  scared  enough  to  run away like this, it shows that there must be a lot in this Jane Finn business! Well,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>we’ll get to the bottom of it. We’ll run them down! We’ll be sleuths in earnest!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, but there’s no one left to sleuth.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, that’s why we’ll have to start all over again. Lend me that bit of pencil.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks.  Wait  a  minute—don’t  interrupt.  There!”  Tuppence  handed  back  the pencil, and surveyed the piece of paper on which she had written with a satisfied eye:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Advertisement.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re not going to put that thing in after all?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it’s a different one.” She handed him the slip of paper.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy read the words on it aloud:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“WANTED, any information respecting Jane Finn. Apply Y. A.”</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<p class="calibre1">WHO IS JANE FINN?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day passed slowly. It was necessary to curtail expenditure. Carefully husbanded, forty pounds will last a long time. Luckily the weather was fine, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“walking is cheap,” dictated Tuppence. An outlying picture house provided them with recreation for the evening.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  day  of  disillusionment  had  been  a  Wednesday.  On  Thursday  the advertisement had duly appeared. On Friday letters might be expected to arrive at Tommy’s rooms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had been bound by an honourable promise not to open any such letters if they did arrive, but to repair to the National Gallery, where his colleague would meet him at ten o’clock.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence  was  first  at  the  rendezvous.  She  ensconced  herself  on  a  red  velvet seat,  and  gazed  at  the  Turners  with  unseeing  eyes  until  she  saw  the  familiar figure enter the room.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”  returned  Mr.  Beresford  provokingly.  “Which  is  your  favourite picture?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be a wretch. Aren’t there  <i class="calibre5">any</i> answers?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy shook his head with a deep and somewhat overacted melancholy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  didn’t  want  to  disappoint  you,  old  thing,  by  telling  you  right  off.  It’s  too bad. Good money wasted.” He sighed. “Still, there it is. The advertisement has appeared, and—there are only two answers!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tommy,  you  devil!”  almost  screamed  Tuppence.  “Give  them  to  me.  How could you be so mean!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your  language,  Tuppence,  your  language!  They’re  very  particular  at  the National  Gallery.  Government  show,  you  know.  And  do  remember,  as  I  have pointed out to you before, that as a clergyman’s daughter——”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I ought to be on the stage!” finished Tuppence with a snap.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is not what I intended to say. But if you are sure that you have enjoyed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>to the full the reaction of joy after despair with which I have kindly provided you free of charge, let us get down to our mail, as the saying goes.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence  snatched  the  two  precious  envelopes  from  him  unceremoniously, and scrutinized them carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thick  paper,  this  one.  It  looks  rich.  We’ll  keep  it  to  the  last  and  open  the other first.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right you are. One, two, three, go!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence’s  little  thumb  ripped  open  the  envelope,  and  she  extracted  the contents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Referring to your advertisement in this morning’s paper, I may be able to be of some use to you. Perhaps you could call and see me at the above address at eleven o’clock to-morrow morning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yours truly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A. CARTER.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“27  Carshalton  Gardens,”  said  Tuppence,  referring  to  the  address.  “That’s Gloucester Road way. Plenty of time to get there if we tube.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  following,”  said  Tommy,  “is  the  plan  of  campaign.  It  is  my  turn  to assume  the  offensive.  Ushered  into  the  presence  of  Mr.  Carter,  he  and  I  wish each other good morning as is customary. He then says: ‘Please take a seat, Mr.</p>
<p class="calibre1">—er?’  To  which  I  reply  promptly  and  significantly:  ‘Edward  Whittington!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereupon  Mr.  Carter  turns  purple  in  the  face  and  gasps  out:  ‘How  much?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds, I rejoin you in the road outside, and we proceed to the next address and repeat the performance.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be absurd, Tommy. Now for the other letter. Oh, this is from the  <i class="calibre5">Ritz! </i>”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A hundred pounds instead of fifty!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll read it:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Re your advertisement, I should be glad if you would call round somewhere about lunch-time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yours truly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha!” said Tommy. “Do I smell a Boche? Or only an American millionaire of unfortunate  ancestry?  At  all  events  we’ll  call  at  lunch-time.  It’s  a  good  time—</p>
<p class="calibre1">frequently leads to free food for two.”</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>Tuppence nodded assent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now for Carter. We’ll have to hurry.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carshalton  Terrace  proved  to  be  an  unimpeachable  row  of  what  Tuppence called “ladylike looking houses.” They rang the bell at No. 27, and a neat maid answered the door. She looked so respectable that Tuppence’s heart sank. Upon Tommy’s  request  for  Mr.  Carter,  she  showed  them  into  a  small  study  on  the ground floor where she left them. Hardly a minute elapsed, however, before the door opened, and a tall man with a lean hawklike face and a tired manner entered the room.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Y. A.?” he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly attractive. “Do sit down, both of you.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">They obeyed. He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and smiled at her encouragingly.  There  was  something  in  the  quality  of  his  smile  that  made  the girl’s usual readiness desert her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As he did not seem inclined to open the conversation, Tuppence was forced to begin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We wanted to know—that is, would you be so kind as to tell us anything you know about Jane Finn?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jane Finn? Ah!” Mr. Carter appeared to reflect. “Well, the question is, what do  <i class="calibre5">you</i> know about her?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence drew herself up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t see that that’s got anything to do with it.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No?  But  it  has,  you  know,  really  it  has.”  He  smiled  again  in  his  tired  way, and  continued  reflectively.  “So  that  brings  us  down  to  it  again.  What  do   <i class="calibre5">you</i> know about Jane Finn?</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come  now,”  he  continued,  as  Tuppence  remained  silent.  “You  must  know <i class="calibre5">something</i> to have advertised as you did?” He leaned forward a little, his weary voice held a hint of persuasiveness. “Suppose you tell me....”</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was something very magnetic about Mr. Carter’s personality. Tuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort, as she said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We couldn’t do that, could we, Tommy?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">But to her surprise, her companion did not back her up. His eyes were fixed on Mr. Carter, and his tone when he spoke held an unusual note of deference.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dare say the little we know won’t be any good to you, sir. But such as it is, you’re welcome to it.”</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>“Tommy!” cried out Tuppence in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Carter slewed round in his chair. His eyes asked a question.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,  sir,  I  recognized  you  at  once.  Saw  you  in  France  when  I  was  with  the Intelligence. As soon as you came into the room, I knew——”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Carter held up his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No names, please. I’m known as Mr. Carter here. It’s my cousin’s house, by the way. She’s willing to lend it to me sometimes when it’s a case of working on strictly  unofficial  lines.  Well,  now”—he  looked  from  one  to  the  other—“who’s going to tell me the story?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fire ahead, Tuppence,” directed Tommy. “It’s your yarn.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, little lady, out with it.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">And  obediently  Tuppence  did  out  with  it,  telling  the  whole  story  from  the forming of the Young Adventurers, Ltd., downwards.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired manner. Now and then he passed his hand across his lips as though to hide a smile. When she had finished he nodded gravely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not much. But suggestive. Quite suggestive. If you’ll excuse my saying so, you’re a curious young couple. I don’t know—you might succeed where others have failed ... I believe in luck, you know—always have....”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He paused a moment, and then went on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, how about it? You’re out for adventure. How would you like to work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses paid, and a moderate screw?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider and wider.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What should we have to do?” she breathed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Carter smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just go on with what you’re doing now.  <i class="calibre5">Find Jane Finn</i>.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, but—who  <i class="calibre5">is</i> Jane Finn?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Carter nodded gravely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, you’re entitled to know that, I think.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He  leaned  back  in  his  chair,  crossed  his  legs,  brought  the  tips  of  his  fingers together, and began in a low monotone:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Secret diplomacy (which, by the way, is nearly always bad policy!) does not concern you. It will be sufficient to say that in the early days of 1915 a certain</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>document came into being. It was the draft of a secret agreement—treaty—call it what  you  like.  It  was  drawn  up  ready  for  signature  by  the  various representatives, and drawn up in America—at that time a neutral country. It was dispatched to England by a special messenger selected for that purpose, a young fellow called Danvers. It was hoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that  nothing  would  have  leaked  out.  That  kind  of  hope  is  usually  disappointed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Somebody always talks!</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Danvers sailed for England on the  <i class="calibre5">Lusitania</i>. He carried the precious papers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin. It was on that particular voyage that the  <i class="calibre5">Lusitania</i> was torpedoed and sunk. Danvers was among the list of those missing.  Eventually  his  body  was  washed  ashore,  and  identified  beyond  any possible doubt. But the oilskin packet was missing!</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself passed it on into  another’s  keeping?  There  were  a  few  incidents  that  strengthened  the possibility  of  the  latter  theory.  After  the  torpedo  struck  the  ship,  in  the  few moments  during  the  launching  of  the  boats,  Danvers  was  seen  speaking  to  a young  American  girl.  No  one  actually  saw  him  pass  anything  to  her,  but  he might  have  done  so.  It  seems  to  me  quite  likely  that  he  entrusted  the  papers  to this girl, believing that she, as a woman, had a greater chance of bringing them safely to shore.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  if  so,  where  was  the  girl,  and  what  had  she  done  with  the  papers?  By later  advice  from  America  it  seemed  likely  that  Danvers  had  been  closely shadowed on the way over. Was this girl in league with his enemies? Or had she, in  her  turn,  been  shadowed  and  either  tricked  or  forced  into  handing  over  the precious packet?</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We  set  to  work  to  trace  her  out.  It  proved  unexpectedly  difficult.  Her  name was Jane Finn, and it duly appeared among the list of the survivors, but the girl herself  seemed  to  have  vanished  completely.  Inquiries  into  her  antecedents  did little to help us. She was an orphan, and had been what we should call over here a pupil teacher in a small school out West. Her passport had been made out for Paris,  where  she  was  going  to  join  the  staff  of  a  hospital.  She  had  offered  her services  voluntarily,  and  after  some  correspondence  they  had  been  accepted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Having seen her name in the list of the saved from the  <i class="calibre5">Lusitania</i>, the staff of the hospital  were  naturally  very  surprised  at  her  not  arriving  to  take  up  her  billet, and at not hearing from her in any way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  every  effort  was  made  to  trace  the  young  lady—but  all  in  vain.  We tracked her across Ireland, but nothing could be heard of her after she set foot in England. No use was made of the draft treaty—as might very easily have been <a id="p35"></a>done—and  we  therefore  came  to  the  conclusion  that  Danvers  had,  after  all, destroyed  it.  The  war  entered  on  another  phase,  the  diplomatic  aspect  changed accordingly, and the treaty was never redrafted. Rumours as to its existence were emphatically  denied.  The  disappearance  of  Jane  Finn  was  forgotten  and  the whole affair was lost in oblivion.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Carter paused, and Tuppence broke in impatiently:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But why has it all cropped up again? The war’s over.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">A hint of alertness came into Mr. Carter’s manner.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because  it  seems  that  the  papers  were  not  destroyed  after  all,  and  that  they might be resurrected to-day with a new and deadly significance.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence stared. Mr. Carter nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, five years ago, that draft treaty was a weapon in our hands; to-day it is a weapon  against  us.  It  was  a  gigantic  blunder.  If  its  terms  were  made  public,  it would  mean  disaster....  It  might  possibly  bring  about  another  war—not  with Germany  this  time!  That  is  an  extreme  possibility,  and  I  do  not  believe  in  its likelihood  myself,  but  that  document  undoubtedly  implicates  a  number  of  our statesmen whom we cannot afford to have discredited in any way at the present moment.  As  a  party  cry  for  Labour  it  would  be  irresistible,  and  a  Labour Government  at  this  juncture  would,  in  my  opinion,  be  a  grave  disability  for British trade, but that is a mere nothing to the  <i class="calibre5">real</i> danger.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He paused, and then said quietly:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  may  perhaps  have  heard  or  read  that  there  is  Bolshevist  influence  at work behind the present Labour unrest?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is the truth. Bolshevist gold is pouring into this country for the specific purpose of procuring a Revolution. And there is a certain man, a man whose real name  is  unknown  to  us,  who  is  working  in  the  dark  for  his  own  ends.  The Bolshevists  are  behind  the  Labour  unrest—but  this  man  is   <i class="calibre5">behind  the</i> <i class="calibre5">Bolshevists</i>.  Who  is  he?  We  do  not  know.  He  is  always  spoken  of  by  the unassuming  title  of  ‘Mr.  Brown.’  But  one  thing  is  certain,  he  is  the  master criminal  of  this  age.  He  controls  a  marvellous  organization.  Most  of  the  Peace propaganda  during  the  war  was  originated  and  financed  by  him.  His  spies  are everywhere.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A naturalized German?” asked Tommy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“On the contrary, I have every reason to believe he is an Englishman. He was pro-German, as he would have been pro-Boer. What he seeks to attain we do not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>know—probably  supreme  power  for  himself,  of  a  kind  unique  in  history.  We have no clue as to his real personality. It is reported that even his own followers are ignorant of it. Where we have come across his tracks, he has always played a secondary part. Somebody else assumes the chief rôle. But afterwards we always find that there has been some nonentity, a servant or a clerk, who has remained in  the  background  unnoticed,  and  that  the  elusive  Mr.  Brown  has  escaped  us once more.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!” Tuppence jumped. “I wonder——”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  remember  in  Mr.  Whittington’s  office.  The  clerk—he  called  him  Brown.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You don’t think——”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter nodded thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very  likely.  A  curious  point  is  that  the  name  is  usually  mentioned.  An idiosyncrasy of genius. Can you describe him at all?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I really didn’t notice. He was quite ordinary—just like anyone else.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Carter sighed in his tired manner.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That  is  the  invariable  description  of  Mr.  Brown!  Brought  a  telephone message to the man Whittington, did he? Notice a telephone in the outer office?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence thought.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I don’t think I did.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.  That  ‘message’  was  Mr.  Brown’s  way  of  giving  an  order  to  his subordinate.  He  overheard  the  whole  conversation  of  course.  Was  it  after  that that Whittington handed you over the money, and told you to come the following day?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, undoubtedly the hand of Mr. Brown!” Mr. Carter paused. “Well, there it is, you see what you are pitting yourselves against? Possibly the finest criminal brain of the age. I don’t quite like it, you know. You’re such young things, both of you. I shouldn’t like anything to happen to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It won’t,” Tuppence assured him positively.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll look after her, sir,” said Tommy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  <i class="calibre5">I</i>’ll look after  <i class="calibre5">you</i>,” retorted Tuppence, resenting the manly assertion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  then,  look  after  each  other,”  said  Mr.  Carter,  smiling.  “Now  let’s  get back  to  business.  There’s  something  mysterious  about  this  draft  treaty  that  we haven’t fathomed yet. We’ve been threatened with it—in plain and unmistakable <a id="p37"></a>terms. The Revolutionary element as good as declare that it’s in their hands, and that  they  intend  to  produce  it  at  a  given  moment.  On  the  other  hand,  they  are clearly at fault about many of its provisions. The Government consider it as mere bluff on their part, and, rightly or wrongly, have stuck to the policy of absolute denial. I’m not so sure. There have been hints, indiscreet allusions, that seem to indicate that the menace is a real one. The position is much as though they had got  hold  of  an  incriminating  document,  but  couldn’t  read  it  because  it  was  in cipher—but  we  know  that  the  draft  treaty  wasn’t  in  cipher—couldn’t  be  in  the nature  of  things—so  that  won’t  wash.  But  there’s   <i class="calibre5">something</i>.  Of  course,  Jane Finn  may  be  dead  for  all  we  know—but  I  don’t  think  so.  The  curious  thing  is that  <i class="calibre5">they’re trying to get information about the girl from us</i>.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.  One  or  two  little  things  have  cropped  up.  And  your  story,  little  lady, confirms my idea. They know we’re looking for Jane Finn. Well, they’ll produce a Jane Finn of their own—say at a  <i class="calibre5">pensionnat</i> in Paris.” Tuppence gasped, and Mr. Carter smiled. “No one knows in the least what she looks like, so that’s all right.  She’s  primed  with  a  trumped-up  tale,  and  her  real  business  is  to  get  as much information as possible out of us. See the idea?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then  you  think”—Tuppence  paused  to  grasp  the  supposition  fully—“that  it <i class="calibre5">was</i> as Jane Finn that they wanted me to go to Paris?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Carter smiled more wearily than ever.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I believe in coincidences, you know,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>CHAPTER V.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MR. JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Tuppence, recovering herself, “it really seems as though it were meant to be.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  know  what  you  mean.  I’m  superstitious  myself.  Luck,  and  all  that  sort  of thing. Fate seems to have chosen you out to be mixed up in this.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy indulged in a chuckle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“My  word!  I  don’t  wonder  Whittington  got  the  wind  up  when  Tuppence plumped out that name! I should have myself. But look here, sir, we’re taking up an awful lot of your time. Have you any tips to give us before we clear out?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think not. My experts, working in stereotyped ways, have failed. You will bring imagination and an open mind to the task. Don’t be discouraged if that too does not succeed. For one thing there is a likelihood of the pace being forced.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence frowned uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“When you had that interview with Whittington, they had time before them. I have information that the big  <i class="calibre5">coup</i> was planned for early in the new year. But the Government is contemplating legislative action which will deal effectually with the  strike  menace.  They’ll  get  wind  of  it  soon,  if  they  haven’t  already,  and  it’s possible that that may bring things to a head. I hope it will myself. The less time they have to mature their plans the better. I’m just warning you that you haven’t much time before you, and that you needn’t be cast down if you fail. It’s not an easy proposition anyway. That’s all.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence rose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think we ought to be businesslike. What exactly can we count upon you for, Mr. Carter?” Mr. Carter’s lips twitched slightly, but he replied succinctly: “Funds within  reason,  detailed  information  on  any  point,  and   <i class="calibre5">no  official  recognition</i>.  I mean  that  if  you  get  yourselves  into  trouble  with  the  police,  I  can’t  officially help you out of it. You’re on your own.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence nodded sagely.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>“I quite understand that. I’ll write out a list of the things I want to know when I’ve had time to think. Now—about money——”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Miss Tuppence. Do you want to say how much?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not exactly. We’ve got plenty to go with for the present, but when we want more——”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It will be waiting for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, but—I’m sure I don’t want to be rude about the Government if you’ve got anything to do with it, but you know one really has the devil of a time getting anything out of it! And if we have to fill up a blue form and send it in, and then, after  three  months,  they  send  us  a  green  one,  and  so  on—well,  that  won’t  be much use, will it?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Carter laughed outright.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t worry, Miss Tuppence. You will send a personal demand to me here, and the money, in notes, shall be sent by return of post. As to salary, shall we say at  the  rate  of  three  hundred  a  year?  And  an  equal  sum  for  Mr.  Beresford,  of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence beamed upon him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“How  lovely.  You  are  kind.  I  do  love  money!  I’ll  keep  beautiful  accounts  of our expenses all debit and credit, and the balance on the right side, and red line drawn sideways with the totals the same at the bottom. I really know how to do it when I think.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sure you do. Well, good-bye, and good luck to you both.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He  shook  hands  with  them,  and  in  another  minute  they  were  descending  the steps of 27 Carshalton Terrace with their heads in a whirl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tommy! Tell me at once, who is ‘Mr. Carter’?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy murmured a name in her ear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!” said Tuppence, impressed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And I can tell you, old bean, he’s IT!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!” said Tuppence again. Then she added reflectively,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I like him, don’t you? He looks so awfully tired and bored, and yet you feel that underneath he’s just like steel, all keen and flashing. Oh!” She gave a skip.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pinch me, Tommy, do pinch me. I can’t believe it’s real!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Beresford obliged.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ow! That’s enough! Yes, we’re not dreaming. We’ve got a job!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what a job! The joint venture has really begun.”</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>“It’s more respectable than I thought it would be,” said Tuppence thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luckily  I  haven’t  got  your  craving  for  crime!  What  time  is  it?  Let’s  have lunch—oh!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">The same thought sprang to the minds of each. Tommy voiced it first.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Julius P. Hersheimmer!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We never told Mr. Carter about hearing from him.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  there  wasn’t  much  to  tell—not  till  we’ve  seen  him.  Come  on,  we’d better take a taxi.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now who’s being extravagant?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“All expenses paid, remember. Hop in.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“At any rate, we shall make a better effect arriving this way,” said Tuppence, leaning back luxuriously. “I’m sure blackmailers never arrive in buses!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve ceased being blackmailers,” Tommy pointed out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not sure I have,” said Tuppence darkly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On inquiring for Mr. Hersheimmer, they were at once taken up to his suite. An impatient voice cried “Come in” in answer to the page-boy’s knock, and the lad stood aside to let them pass in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Julius  P.  Hersheimmer  was  a  great  deal  younger  than  either  Tommy  or Tuppence  had  pictured  him.  The  girl  put  him  down  as  thirty-five.  He  was  of middle height, and squarely built to match his jaw. His face was pugnacious but pleasant. No one could have mistaken him for anything but an American, though he spoke with very little accent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get  my  note?  Sit  down  and  tell  me  right  away  all  you  know  about  my cousin.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your cousin?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure thing. Jane Finn.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is she your cousin?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“My  father  and  her  mother  were  brother  and  sister,”  explained  Mr.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hersheimmer meticulously.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!” cried Tuppence. “Then you know where she is?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” Mr. Hersheimmer brought down his fist with a bang on the table. “I’m darned if I do! Don’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We advertised to receive information, not to give it,” said Tuppence severely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I guess I know that. I can read. But I thought maybe it was her back history</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>you were after, and that you’d know where she was now?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, we wouldn’t mind hearing her back history,” said Tuppence guardedly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Mr. Hersheimmer seemed to grow suddenly suspicious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“See  here,”  he  declared.  “This  isn’t  Sicily!  No  demanding  ransom  or threatening  to  crop  her  ears  if  I  refuse.  These  are  the  British  Isles,  so  quit  the funny business, or I’ll just sing out for that beautiful big British policeman I see out there in Piccadilly.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy hastened to explain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We haven’t kidnapped your cousin. On the contrary, we’re trying to find her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re employed to do so.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Hersheimmer leant back in his chair.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put me wise,” he said succinctly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy fell in with this demand in so far as he gave him a guarded version of the disappearance of Jane Finn, and of the possibility of her having been mixed up  unawares  in  “some  political  show.”  He  alluded  to  Tuppence  and  himself  as “private  inquiry  agents”  commissioned  to  find  her,  and  added  that  they  would therefore be glad of any details Mr. Hersheimmer could give them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That gentleman nodded approval.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  guess  that’s  all  right.  I  was  just  a  mite  hasty.  But  London  gets  my  goat!  I only know little old New York. Just trot out your questions and I’ll answer.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">For  the  moment  this  paralysed  the  Young  Adventurers,  but  Tuppence, recovering  herself,  plunged  boldly  into  the  breach  with  a  reminiscence  culled from detective fiction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“When did you last see the dece—your cousin, I mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never seen her,” responded Mr. Hersheimmer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” demanded Tommy, astonished.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hersheimmer turned to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, sir. As I said before, my father and her mother were brother and sister, just  as  you  might  be”—Tommy  did  not  correct  this  view  of  their  relationship</p>
<p class="calibre1">—“but they didn’t always get on together. And when my aunt made up her mind to  marry  Amos  Finn,  who  was  a  poor  school  teacher  out  West,  my  father  was just mad! Said if he made his pile, as he seemed in a fair way to do, she’d never see a cent of it. Well, the upshot was that Aunt Jane went out West and we never heard from her again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The old man  <i class="calibre5">did</i> pile it up. He went into oil, and he went into steel, and he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>played  a  bit  with  railroads,  and  I  can  tell  you  he  made  Wall  Street  sit  up!”  He paused. “Then he died—last fall—and I got the dollars. Well, would you believe it, my conscience got busy! Kept knocking me up and saying: What about your Aunt  Jane,  way  out  West?  It  worried  me  some.  You  see,  I  figured  it  out  that Amos Finn would never make good. He wasn’t the sort. End of it was, I hired a man  to  hunt  her  down.  Result,  she  was  dead,  and  Amos  Finn  was  dead,  but they’d  left  a  daughter—Jane—who’d  been  torpedoed  in  the   <i class="calibre5">Lusitania</i>  on  her way  to  Paris.  She  was  saved  all  right,  but  they  didn’t  seem  able  to  hear  of  her over this side. I guessed they weren’t hustling any, so I thought I’d come along over, and speed things up. I phoned Scotland Yard and the Admiralty first thing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Admiralty  rather  choked  me  off,  but  Scotland  Yard  were  very  civil—said they  would  make  inquiries,  even  sent  a  man  round  this  morning  to  get  her photograph. I’m off to Paris to-morrow, just to see what the Prefecture is doing. I guess if I go to and fro hustling them, they ought to get busy!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">The energy of Mr. Hersheimmer was tremendous. They bowed before it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  say  now,”  he  ended,  “you’re  not  after  her  for  anything?  Contempt  of court,  or  something  British?  A  proud-spirited  young  American  girl  might  find your  rules  and  regulations  in  war  time  rather  irksome,  and  get  up  against  it.  If that’s the case, and there’s such a thing as graft in this country, I’ll buy her off.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence reassured him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s good. Then we can work together. What about some lunch? Shall we have it up here, or go down to the restaurant?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuppence  expressed  a  preference  for  the  latter,  and  Julius  bowed  to  her decision.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Oysters  had  just  given  place  to  Sole  Colbert  when  a  card  was  brought  to Hersheimmer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Inspector  Japp,  C.I.D.  Scotland  Yard  again.  Another  man  this  time.  What does he expect I can tell him that I didn’t tell the first chap? I hope they haven’t lost  that  photograph.  That  Western  photographer’s  place  was  burned  down  and all his negatives destroyed—this is the only copy in existence. I got it from the principal of the college there.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">An unformulated dread swept over Tuppence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You—you don’t know the name of the man who came this morning?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,  I  do.  No,  I  don’t.  Half  a  second.  It  was  on  his  card.  Oh,  I  know!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inspector Brown. Quiet, unassuming sort of chap.”</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>CHAPTER VI.</p>
